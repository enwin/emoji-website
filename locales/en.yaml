        - "The emoji set embedded in Firefox OS (<em>NotoColorEmoji</em>) comes from Android KitKat and is incomplete. You might find that some emojis are missing (like the flags) and others are not colored but displayed as black shapes. The black shape emojis come from the fallback font <em>AndroidEmoji</em> that contains a bit more emoji symbols."
        - "As long as Mozilla doesn't include a complete set of emoji symbols the keyboard won't be able to display them properly."
